As a way to try out MongoDB Stitch, I decided to veer away from the usual "todo" app, that seems to be the new "hello world" standard for developers. The Philippine pop culture has been as creative as always and last month (or so), the Filipino millennial generation coined new slangs that have somehow trended a bit. Thus, to ride this temporary trend, I started writing up a simple web application utilizing just MongoDB Stitch and JavaScript. The app is as simple as it gets, it parses a Filipino phrase and translates it to the slang using the key-value pairs stored in the database. To add spice a bit, it keeps track of how may time a slang is used and allows users to suggest new terms. If you are interested, here's a link to the app, [Lodify](http//bit.ly/lodify).
